# GSE57955

This is a GEO dataset of penile cancer (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE57955) published in PMID: 25908946. 

It consists of 39 fresh-frozen PSCC samples arrayed on the Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome Microarray 4x44k G4112F. It is a two-channel array, with the 
control channel being normal pool from 5 autopsy glands.

HPV is not available from GEO. Do note, however, that a parallel analysis
of CNA (GSE50134) was performed on the same samples and the HPV
status was linked in that publication to the HPV status. See `data-raw/hpv_curation`
for details.

## Array Annotation
The annotation for the array (from GEO) is GPL6480 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL6480). it is difficult to determine if there is a newer version of annotation available.
